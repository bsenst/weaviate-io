Welcome to the Weaviate **Getting Started** guide.

The Getting Started is designed to quickly teach you how to use Weaviate in an application. Each section should just take a few minutes of your time.

In this guide, we will show you how to:
- Spin up an instance of Weaviate
- Set up a database schema, including cross-references
- Import data to populate the database, and
- Perform queries to retrieve relevant data 

By the end of the guide, you will end up with a basic, but fully functioning vector database with publication and author data. You will also have seen how to perform ðŸš€ fast vector searches within that database to retrieve and discover relevant information.

Have fun working with Weaviate, and please do let us know on our Slack when you have questions or if you have a cool use case to share!

## Before you start 

The guide assumes that you are somewhat familiar with databases, know what vector embeddings are, and can read basic JSON and GraphQL. 

But don't worry too much even if you are uncomfortable with any of these areas. You should be able to follow along the with guide!
